## Hi, I'm Mirah

![Mirah halfway up a the Drachenwand klettersteig in Austria. She is wearing a helmet and sunglasses and has a backpack with hydration system slung over her shoulder.](/klettersteig.jpg)

I like hiking and climbing in the mountains

and I play [roller derby](https://wftda.com), currently for [Bear City Roller Derby](https://bearcityrollerderby.com/).

## Work

Currently, I work at VMware, where I'm the technical lead for the messaging and streaming program. We build [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com).

I've given a few talks on things like [Concourse best practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEHzcgr11Ao) and leading teams into maintenance mode.

I used to be a theoretical physicist, working on String Theory and Quantum Gravity ([Publications](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=f%20a%20gary%2C%20m)).
